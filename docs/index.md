The <span class="wags-brand">wags</span> toolkit is based on state-of-the-art research into how multi-turn agents usually fail, and makes it straightforward to implement advanced countermeasures. While Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources, we still don't fully understand what makes a good MCP server. <span class="wags-brand">wags</span> makes it easy to deploy the latest research on context engineering and several new MCP features improve user and agent experience without rewriting your existing MCP servers.
